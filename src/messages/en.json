      "p2": "Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster.",
      "p3": "GraphQL is a playground/IDE for graphQL requests. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.",
      "p4": "Overall, our project provides you a solution that makes interacting with GraphQL and Postman easier and more efficient. You can experiment with various endpoints, input queries, manage variables and headers, and then enjoy the results of your efforts. We believe this will be a useful addition to any project.",
      "p5": "This project was created as part of the course RS School.React Course",
